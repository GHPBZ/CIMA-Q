# CIMA-Q
## Overview
Alzheimer's and related diseases (AD) affect 10% of individuals after the age of 65 and this percentage increases to 35% after the age of 85. Coordinated efforts are necessary to reduce the psychological, social and economic burden that AD place on patients, their families and society as a whole. Currently, AD is typically diagnosed when symptoms are already present, with cognition, quality of life, and autonomy affected significantly, however as evidence shows years after neurodegeneration has started in the brain. The Consortium for early identification of Alzheimer's disease - Québec (CIMA-Q) aims to (1) develop new methods enabling an earlier diagnosis and (2) acquire a better understanding of the initial pathophysiological stages of AD in order to develop more effective an earlier treatments, able to curb the trajectory of decline.

## Participants
The CIMA-Q cohort participants are representative of different AD stages (pre-symptomatic and symptomatic) and clinical presentations (e.g., comorbidity). Moreover, we also recruited cognitively healthy elderly volunteers and healthy young volunteers to obtain comparison values on targeted cognitive and biological measures. Participants were recruited from different settings: the NuAge cohort, memory clinics, the community (advertisements and participant banks at participating sites) and the CCNA project.

As of March 2024, **412 participants aged 65 and over** have been recruited (64 % women): **36** are individuals with Alzheimer’s type dementia (AD), **130** individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), **178** individuals with subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), and **68** cognitively healthy elderly participants (C).

There were up to 9 evaluation time points over 8 years: 5 complete evaluations and 4 brief evaluations.

Recruitment started at the end of 2014 and 8-year follow-ups began recently. Our objective is to reach a total of 350 elderly participants with at least one completed follow-up (2 years from baseline) for all the SCI (150) and MCI (100) participants.

## Methods and available data
All participants included in the study receive thorough neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric assessments, provide blood samples, and further undergo a clinical evaluation (clinical questionnaires, neurological and physical examination, blood tests).  We also collect magnetic resonance neuroimaging data (MRI) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from consenting participants. Finally, we collect additional information from a study partner (informant) (Belleville, *et al*. 2019).

Participants undergo mandatory in-person assessments at the initial visit and are invited back every 2 years (years 2, 4, 6, and 8). For year 1, 3, 5, and 7, they are contacted by phone for brief clinical assessments.

Participants can also consent to brain donation. Each collected brain undergoes neuropathological evaluation and is deposited at the Douglas-Bell Canada Brain Bank for research purposes.
